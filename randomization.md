The Randomization Test tab contains functions that help in statistically analyzing a single-case experiment by conducting randomization tests on observed data. The following functions can be found.

* **Observed test statistic**: The observed test statistic is calculated from the obtained raw data.

* **Randomization distribution**: The randomization distribution is generated by a complete enumeration of all assignment possibilities or by a random sample of all assignment possibilities. The distribution is displayed as a vector and as a histogram (in which the observed test statistic is also marked).

* **P-value**: The P-value corresponding to the observed value of the test statistic is obtained by locating this value in the randomization distribution generated by a complete enumeration of all assignment possibilities or by a random sample of all assignment possibilities.

The following parameters may need to be set for the functions in Randomization Test tab.

* **Select the design type**: Type of single-case design. The options are *AB Phase Design*, *ABA Phase Design*, *ABAB Phase Design*, *Completely Randomized Design*, *Randomized Block Design*, *Alternating Treatments Design*, *Multiple Baseline Design* and *User Specified Design*.

* **Minimum number of observations per phase**: Only required for phase designs (*AB Phase Design*, *ABA Phase Design* and *ABAB Phase Design*). Minimum number of observations needed per phase (baseline or treatment).

* **Maximum number of consecutive administrations of the same condition**: Only required for *Alternating Treatments Design*. The maximum number of consecutive administrations of the same condition (baseline or treatment) allowed.

* **Multiple Baseline Design: Select text file containing possible start points**: Only required for *Multiple Baseline Design*. A text file containing all possible startpoints for treatment is required. In this startpoint file, each row should contain all possibilities for one unit, separated by a tab. The rows and columns should not be labeled.

* **User Specified Design: Select text file containing possible assignments**: Only required for *User Specified Design*. Text file where all the possible assignments can be found.

* **Select the test statistic**: Test statistic. For *AB Phase Design*, *Completely Randomized Design*, *Randomized Block Design*, *Alternating Treatments Design*, *Multiple Baseline Design* and *User Specified Design*, there are 3 built-in possibilities: *A-B*, *B-A*, and *|A-B|*, which stand for the (absolute value of the) difference between condition means. For phase designs with more than 2 phases (*ABA Phase Design* and *ABAB Phase Design*), 6 more built-in options are available: *PA-PB*, *PB-PA*, and *|PA-PB|* refer to the (absolute value of the) difference between the means of phase means, and *AA-BB*, *BB-AA* and *|AA-BB|* represent the (absolute value of the) difference between the sums of phase means. Additionally, it is possible to specify a *Custom* test statistic.

* **Define test statistic**: Only required if *Custom* test statistic is selected. Any test statistic can be specified using the variable identifiers *A* and *B* (or in the case of *ABA Phase Design* and *ABAB Phase Design*, *A1*, *B1*, *A2*, *B2*, *A* and *B*) and any of the basic R functions. For example, *abs(mean(A) - mean(B))* can be specified as a test statistic and it is the same as selecting *|A-B|*.

* **Select the randomization distribution**: Type of randomization distribution. The options are *Systematic randomization distribution* (exhaustive randomization distribution generated by a complete enumeration of all assignment possibilities) and *Monte Carlo randomization distribution* (nonexhaustive randomization distribution generated by a random sample of all assignment possibilities). Please note that the randomization distribution generated by *Monte Carlo randomization distribution* may not be the same as that generated by *Systematic randomization distribution*, consequently the p-values calculated by the two methods may not be equal.

* **Monte Carlo: Number of randomizations**: Only required if *Monte Carlo randomization distribution* is selected. Number of randomizations required.
