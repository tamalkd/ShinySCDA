#### Welcome to the help section!

This web app aims to makes it easy to design and analyze single-case experiments. It is possible to design single-case phase, alternation and multiple-baseline experiments, and conduct visual examination and randomization tests on data gathered by means of such designs. 

This section contains information on how to use the web app. The functions in this web app are organized into the following tabs based on a natural progression of functions needed over the course of conducting a single-case experiment.

* **Design**
* **Data**
* **Visual Analysis**
* **Randomization Test**
* **Meta-Analysis**

Inside each tab, the navigation panel on the left can be used to select a function among those available.

Once a function is selected, the parameters for the function can be set in the middle panel. The parameters displayed are dynamically generated. Hence changing one parameter may lead to changes in other parameters. Some parameters may be hidden if they are not necessary in the context of values selected for other parameters. 

Once the parameters are set, clicking the button at the bottom of the parameter panel will execute the function. The output is displayed on the rightmost panel.

Please check the other tabs for information on the specific functions available.
